# Panorama-Stitching-by-SIFT-algorithm

This project is Panorama Stitching by SIFT algorithm. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is a feature detection algorithm in computer vision to detect and describe local features in images. In this implementation, I use Gaussian Pyramid, RANdom SAmple Consensus(RANSAC). You can also choose other algorithm to detect the feature points and calculate the homography matrix.

## Environment
